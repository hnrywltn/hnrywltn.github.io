									<h3 class="major">Personalization</h3>
									<p>A lot of the time people would come to me with a feeling instead of a plan. As a professional, I believe it's our responsibility to help clients deconstruct their needs in order to build something they can be proud of.</p>

									<p>Instead of relying on a simple, "what do you want?", I make it part of my process to put myself in their shoes and implement things how they would if they had the skill set. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Education</h3>
									<p>For two years I was an educator for 450+ employees over a 5 state territory. I got to travel and teach small groups artistry and sales techniques. This is where I found my passion for explaining things in digestable ways.</p>


                  <p>Catering a teaching approach to different learning types is important in education. Also, recognizing different approaches and shifting them to what I need as I'm being taught is a skill I wasn't expecting to pick up. It has made me a much faster learner and I love talking about it.</p>
